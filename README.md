## How can I run it?

To run the experiments, you will need `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` libraries.

Use the input data files, provided in /data folder, and these scripts:
* `binary_indicies_bruteforce.py [<num_of_items, default=5>]` -- to reproduce the table N3
* `meteo_inversion_matrix.py [full|10m|2h]` -- to reproduce tables N4, N10, N11
* `multiclass_indicies_imagenet.py` -- to reproduce tables N5 and N12
* `multiclass_indicies_sst.py` -- to reproduce the table N6
* `multiclass_indicies_yeast.py` -- to reproduce tables N13 and N14
